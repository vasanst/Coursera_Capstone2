Raj is very much excited about this project and migration to Canada, but at the same time, he is concerned about the food choices that Toronto has to offer, as he is a pure vegetarian by birth.  \n\nHis only concern is that he wants to find a place where his place of stay is very close to Vegetarian/Vegan restaurants in particular.\n\n<b>The objective of this project is to solve Raj's problem, by exploring and comparing the nearby places, where there are Vegetarian/Vegan restaurants nearby, where he can put himself up, during his stay at Canada"

I then explored the history of that Wiki page and was able to find the previous version, which I ultimately used in completing this project.\n\nThat minor glitch apart, throughout this project, problem solving was a breeze mainly due to the plethora of libraries that Python has offered for various tasks like, mining, extracting, transforming and visualizing the data.  I gained tremendous amount of experience throughout the course and I thank Coursera for that."
